# Dictionary web app

## demo
https://react-dictionarywebapp.netlify.app/

This is frontendmentor.io challenge:
" Your challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the Dictionary API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

Search for words using the input field
See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
Play the audio file for a word when it's available
Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
Switch between light and dark themes
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS."

## Features
- Search words and get data from dictionary API
- change theme between dark and light. Selected theme is saved to localstorage
- change font between 3 options. Selected font is saved to localstorage
